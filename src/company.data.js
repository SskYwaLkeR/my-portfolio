  companyIntro: `Last year 2019 I had the amazing opportunity to work with We18, a software consultancy agency in Pune, India.  I work closely with  Senior Developers to build multiple client facing products. It was an amazing experience
  as it was my first internship and I was as nervous as nervous gets.
   `,
  companyIntro2: `Throught the internship I was pushed and challenged in every aspect of my skills and walked away as
  much refined developer.`,
  internshipGoal: `Prior to internship I had set some goal for myself so that I had clear objectives on what I wanted to improve
  on and accomplish. Of theses goals my main priority was to improve my react and web development skill. My other
  specific goal was to improve my ability as a member of team.`,
  challenges: ` There were times I encountered some difficulties but this internship was most challenging and most
   rewarding  experience for me. Travelling to different city and experiencing a completely new team taught 
   me so much about myself and about the profession I want to be .`,

  challenges2: ` At We18, I learned a ton about React, Material design, Git, and about software development in general. I also learned so much about how to be a developer with integrity and a valuable member 
    of a team. Working alongside extremely talented developers inspired me and pushed my bounds of 
    what I believed any developer can do`,

  contribution: `I spent my majority of work building reusable components in react. I worked alongside other
  developers to implement solutions based on client requirements and modified code to fix bugs.`,

  overview: `As it was my first internship , my experience with We18 will be something I will remember forever, and
  I want to thank everyone at We18 for giving me such an amazing experience. I am so grateful to Narendra Sisodiya
  for the mentorship he provide me, and the react concepts he taught me. `,

export const tuutr = {
  title: `Tuutr`,
  companyIntro: `Tuutr is a ed-tech startup company based in Bangalore, India. I worked closely with a designer to build frontend for our online classroom. 

  `,
  companyIntro2: `Working at Tuutr was different experience for me, as we  were small team of just
  three people. I learnt a lot here from taking ownership of work, to work with integrity as an individual developer in a largescale project. `,
  internshipGoal: `Just like my previous internship , I set my own objective before working at Tuutr, my main goal
  was to improve as an engineer, as well as improve my interpersonal skills.`,
  challenges: `I was in fear before joining tuutr that how will I be able to contribute since I had no experience of working with Vue.js which 
  was primary frontend framework of Tuutr.`,

  challenges2: `Here I learned so much about vue in a quick succession, I pushed my limit from
  just a react developer to be a good understanding and responsible engineer.`,

  contribution: `I spent my majority of work building components in vue, mostly for our classroom page which was very
  complex as it handles presentation of instructors, live lectures, chat room and other complicated aspects of an online classroom.`,

  overview: `I learnt so much at Tuutr that I will carry through the rest of my life, specially the fact that as a developer I dont have to be an expert in everything in order to build something. We can learn quickly on the
  fly and just accomplish the task. Thanks to the incredible mentorship of Haider (founder), he constantly helped me with my
  doubts over vue and programming in general and also improved me as a person.`,
