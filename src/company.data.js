  companyIntro: `Last year 2019 I had the amazing opportunity to work with We18, a software consultancy agency in Pune, India 
  .  I work closely with  Senior Developers to build multiple client facing products. It was an amazing experience
  as it was my first internship and I was as nervous as nervous gets. Before my internship I had so many question and worries: How will I handle
  the work, what will my seniors be like, but I overcome those and learned so many things about software development.
   `,
  companyIntro2: `Throught the internship I was pushed and challenged in every aspect of my skills and walked away as
  much refined developer.`,
  internshipGoal: `Prior to internship I had set some goal for myself so that I had clear objectives on what I wanted to improve
  on and accomplish. Of theses goals my main priority was to improve my react and web development skill. My other
  specific goal was to improve my ability as a member of team.`,
  challenges: ` There were times I encountered some difficulties but this internship was most challenging and most
   rewarding  experience for me. Travelling to different city and experiencing a completely new team taught 
   me so much about myself and about the profession I want to be .`,

  challenges2: ` At we18, I learned a ton about React, Material design, Git,
    but I also learned so much about how to be a developer with integrity and a valuable member 
    of a team. Working alongside extremely talented developers inspired me and pushed my bounds of 
    what I believed any developer can do`,

  contribution: `I spent my majority of work building reusable components in react. I worked alongside other
  developers to implement solutions based on client requirements and modified code to fix bugs.`,

  overview: `As it was my first internship , my experience with We18 will be something I will remember forever, and
  I want to thank everyone at We18 for giving me such an amazing experience. I am so grateful to Narendra Sisodiya
  for the mentorship he provide me, and the react concepts he taught me. `,
